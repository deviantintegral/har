[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/deviantintegral/har.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/deviantintegral/har) [![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/dt/deviantintegral/har?style=flat-square)](https://packagist.org/packages/deviantintegral/har)

## Requirements

* PHP 7.2+
* The `ext-json` extension.

## Installation

`composer require deviantintegral/har`, or
[download the CLI tool](https://github.com/deviantintegral/har/releases).

## Introduction

This library supports reading and writing [HTTP Archive](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/) files. These
archives are JSON objects containing one or more HTTP request and response pairs. In particular, this library is useful
for taking HTTP requests exported from a browser's developer tools or with a proxy like
[mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org) and using them as mocks in tests.

Features include:

* Reading a HAR into a fully-typed set of classes.
* Writing a `\Deviantintegral\Har\Har` back out into a HAR JSON string.
* Adapters for PSR-7 Request and Response interfaces.
* An interface and `\Deviantintegral\Har\HarRepository` class to load HARs from a filesystem or other backend.
* [A CLI tool](https://github.com/deviantintegral/har/releases) to split a HAR file into single files per request / response pair.

## Example

See [ReadmeTest.php](tests/src/Unit/ReadmeTest.php) for an example of how to use this library.

## Optional values

The HAR specification documents some fields as `-1` if they do not have a
value. Other fields, like `comment`, may be omitted.

Fields that may be omitted will have a `has` method that should be called
before calling `get`. For integer fields, the return value must be checked for
`-1`.
